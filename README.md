# Revit WPF Template
Template in visual studio for creating Revit C# .net addin with WPF

WPF in Revit API maybe make some difficulties for the first times to work with it.
As a beginner and a selt-touch developper, I waste many times to understand how does it works.
So, I create this template to using in my future other projects.

### About this template

In this template, I show how I use:
  - Organize project with MVVM pattern
  - Create and raise external event of Revit API with modeless form WPF
  - Binding command totally, not using event in code behind
  - Fix some problem with modeless forme: topmost, Window owner, minimize Window
  - Integrate type Window, Usercontrol in this template
  - Utils for image of icon of ribbon constrol Revit
  - Work with Json settings file
 
 
 ### How to use it?

* Clone/download this repository and open the .sln at the root of the repository with Microsoft Visual Studio.
* Re-link references to RevitAPI.dll and others which may be missing  and restore package from nuget package manager
* Build the solution - Building the solution will automatically create and copy the add-in files to the folder for Revit 2019.
Location  --  C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\2019\TD.Bundle
You can change it in Post-Built Event Command Line (Project --> Properties --> Build Event)

* In order to use this as a starter for your application, make sure you first refactor the content in the application files (namespace, assembly name, classes, GUID, etc.).
* You can create a template visual studio like the template Revit API of thebuildingcoder.
